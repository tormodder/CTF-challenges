The challenges were made for the general student mass at NTNU gj√∏vik, with very varied knowledge of CTF. Mostly the challenges are relatively easy, so they might be fun to practice with if someone comes accross this.

Generally the web challenges can be deployed using the supplied docker container. for pwn I've mostly just kept the binary directly in the repo for the pwn challenges to not have to spell out the intented compilation command.
